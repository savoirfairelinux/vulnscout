== [blue]#icon:sign-in[]# Introduction

VulnScout is designed to analyse and identify vulnerabilities in their software components and dependencies using an *SBOM* (Software Bill Of Materials).

It pulls known vulnerabilities from public sources like the NVD, EPSS, and Grype to figure out which parts of a codebase might be affected by security issues (CVE).

VulnScout also provides a web interface for visualisation and a command line to generate enriched output files.

=== VulnsScout Features

* Analyse SBOMs
* Detect vulnerabilities
* Enrich SBOM files
* Generate detailed reports
* Help track fixes with the dashboard

== icon:download[] Installing VulnScout

=== Requirements

VulnScout is designed to run locally in a Docker container.
It will require having `docker-compose` or `docker compose` available on your host.

If you need to install `docker compose`, look at:
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[docker-compose]

=== Installation

To install VulnScout, you only need to clone the repository:
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/vulnscout.git
cd vulnscout
----

=== Run VulnScout demo

This project contains a default usable example of Vulnscout.
To use it, you can simply run the default script with the command:

[source,shell]
----
./start-example.sh
----

Or, if you prefer to run another example based on SPDX-3.0, you can use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
./start-example.sh --spdx3
----
These commands will use the docker-compose files located here: _/.vulnscout/example/_

== [black]#icon:linux[]# Use VulnScount with Yocto

We have a dedicated layer for Vulnscout integration in Yocto.

You can find the layer here: https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/meta-vulnscout[meta-vulnscout]

To be short, a simple `inherit vulnscout` in your image recipe will be enough to configure VulnScout for your project.

The VulnScout web interface can be started with a `bitbake <image-recipe> -c vulnscout` command.

== icon:lock[] Manually start VulnScout

You can start the VulnScout docker container with a `docker compose` or `docker-compose` command:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose -f </path/to/yaml> up
----

Then open your browser to view the results:

[source,plaintext]
----

* Information embedded in input files

=== icon:shield[] Custom CVSS Scoring

Vulnscount allows you to add a custom CVSS vector string to a vulnerability, enabling organisation-specific vulnerability scoring.
