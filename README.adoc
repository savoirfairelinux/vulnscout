== Introduction

Scanning project to export Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and list of Vulnerabilities that affect them.
Support for Cyclone DX, SPDX, Yocto JSON files and Open VEX.

This document use a lot of format names, accronyms and abbreviations which is evident for people working on them, but not for everyone. Here is a definition of the most used ones:

[unordered]
CVE:: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Most (but not all) vulnerabilities discovered by a security researcher are assigned a CVE number. This number is unique and is used to reference the vulnerability in various databases.
SBOM:: Software Bill of Materials. A list of all the components used in a software project. This list can be used to track dependencies, licenses, and vulnerabilities.
SPDX:: Software Package Data Exchange. A standard format for SBOMs developed by the Linux Foundation. Mostly found as JSON or XML files.
CDX:: Cyclone DX. A standard format for SBOMs developed as an OWASP project. Mostly found as JSON or XML files.
Yocto:: A build system for embedded Linux systems. It is used to build custom Linux distributions for embedded systems.

== Usage

You can use VulnScout to scan your project, make report about your dependencies and vulnerabilities, and to manage them.

**Support following inputs** :

* ##WIP##: SPDX 2.4 (Packages)
* ##Draft##: SPDX 3.0 (Packages + vulnerabilities)
* ##WIP##: Cyclone DX 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 (Packages + vulnerabilities)
* Grype native JSON format (Packages + vulnerabilities)
* Yocto JSON output of `cve-check` module (Packages + vulnerabilities)

**Support following outputs** :

* SPDX 2.3 (Packages)
* ##Draft##: SPDX 3.0 (Packages + vulnerabilities)
* Cyclone DX 1.5 (Packages)
* ##WIP##: Cyclone DX 1.5 (vulnerabilities)
* ##WIP##: Cyclone DX 1.4, 1.6 (Packages + vulnerabilities)
* ##WIP##: openVex (vulnerabilities + Assessments)

== Deployment

This project is made to run on local in a docker container.

=== Recommended setup using vulnscout.sh wrapper

1. Copy `bin/vulnscout.sh` at root of your project repository.

2. Create a `.vulnscout` folder at root of your project repository. +
Copy one of the example file in `bin/.vulnscout-example` folder into your `.vulnscout` folder. +
Adjust theses variables to your needs.

3. Run `./vulnscout.sh scan` to start the scanner and open http://localhost:7275 to view the results.

4. If you get error when running container, try use `docker login` to authenticate to the registry. +
More information on <<Authentification>> section.

=== Alternative setup: Build and use a local image

1. Start by building the image at root of repository: +
`BUILD_TAG="local-build" cqfd -b docker_build run`

2. Then, copy `bin/vulnscout.sh` into root of your project repository. Create a `.vulnscout` folder also at root. +
Copy one of the `.rc` conf file from `bin/.vulnscout-example` into your `.vulnscout` folder.l`.

3. In your new copied file, customize variables to bind the correct paths. +
Replace the `DOCKER_IMAGE` value by your image name like `vulnscout:local-build`.

Now, after each build, you can run `./vulnscout.sh scan` to run a new scan and open http://localhost:7275 to view the results.

=== Alternative setup: Use docker-compose instead of vulnscout.sh

1. Copy `docker-compose.template.yml` from this repository as `docker-compose.yml` at root of your project repository.

2. Edit this file to bind your volumes. Follow instructions in the file. Then adjust environment variables.

3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the scanner and open http://localhost:7275 to view the results.

== Specific configuration

=== Configuration for Yocto projects

After having setup one of the <<Deployment>> tutorial, you have some steps needed make Yocto output necessary files.

1. In the Yocto repository, if you use git submodules features, you can run: +
`git submodule add https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/meta-cyclonedx.git sources/meta-cyclonedx` +
(tips: if you have a `.gitmodules`, you should use this command).

2. If you don't have a `.gitmodules` file and don't want to use git submodules, you can add the source manually by going in `sources` folder and running the following command: `git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/meta-cyclonedx.git`

3. Add the following lines if their are not present in your `layers.conf` file: +
[source,conf]
----
INHERIT += "create-spdx" <1>
INHERIT += "cyclonedx-export" <2>
INHERIT += "cve-check" <3>
include conf/distro/include/cve-extra-exclusions.inc <4>
----
<1> Native export to SPDX, handled by Yocto
<2> Export to Cyclone DX format, made by the meta-cyclonedx layer
<3> Check for CVE using Native Yocto tool
<4> Exclude some old CVE that was corrected

Then you are almost ready. Make a new build of your Yocto project to generate SPDX, CDX and CVE files. +
To allow vulnscout to find your SBOM files, ensure you have copied and configured `.rc` file in the `.vulnscout` folder. +
If you haven't already done it, check at the example in `bin/.vulnscout-example/yocto.rc` folder of `sfl/vulnscout` project.

=== Configuration tips for others projects

If you are not using Yocto, you can still use the scanner. What you need is at least one SBOM in SPDX or CDX format. Grype and OSV scanner will then try to find all vulnerabilities matchign packages in the SBOM. If your SBOM includes vulnerabilities, they will also be included in the final merge.

If you followed correctly the <<Deployment>> section, you should have a `.vulnscout` folder at the root of your project.
You can edit this file in it and make the path bindings for SPDX / CDX variables:

[TIP]
====
- You can delete the YOCTO_CVE variable if you don't use Yocto CVE-check.
- You can refer as many files and folder as needed. They are Bash arrays.
- Scanner support reading in `.tar`, `.tar.zst` and `.tar.gz` archives.
- If your inputs may contains invalid files, you can set `IGNORE_PARSING_ERRORS` to `true` in your `.rc` file.
====

You can now run `./vulnscout.sh scan` to start the scanner and open http://localhost:7275 to view the results.

== Authentification

If you get an error while using vulnscout.sh or docker-compose, you may need to authenticate to the registry.
The image is not public but hosted on Gitlab registry. To authentificate:

1. Open https://gitlab.savoirfairelinux.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens in your browser.

2. Create a new token with the following scope: `read_registry` and set expiration to what you want.

3. Enter a name, create the token and copy it.

4. In a terminal, run `docker login gitlab.savoirfairelinux.com:5050` and enter your Gitlab username and the token as password.

TIP: If you have already logged in the registry but want to change the password, add `-u <username>` to the command. It will re-ask for password.

NOTE: If after authentification you still fail to pull image, verify you have access to https://gitlab.savoirfairelinux.com/pe/vulnscout . If not, ask for access to the project.
