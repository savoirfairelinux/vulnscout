== Name
       vulnscout-ci - Evaluate and enforce conditions on vulnerabilities within a project.

== Synopsis
       *vulnscout ci* [_CONDITION_]

== Description
       The `vulnscout ci` command can optionally accept a CONDITION
       argument that causes the command to fail if the specified
       condition is met by any vulnerability found in the project.

       The _CONDITION_ is a string that follows the syntax described
       below. It is evaluated against each vulnerability identified.
       If the condition is met, the names of the vulnerabilities that
       trigger the condition are displayed in the output. The command
       will return an exit code of *2* if at least one vulnerability meets
       the condition.

       If the _CONDITION_ is invalid, the configuration is not found, or
       an error occurs during the process, the command will return an
       exit code of *1*. This allows users to differentiate between a
       configuration error and a condition error.

== Options
       _CONDITION_
              A string representing the criteria used to evaluate each
              vulnerability. The syntax of this string is defined below.

== Exit Status
       *0*::
              Success.
       *1*::
              Configuration error or invalid condition.
       *2*::
              Condition met by at least one vulnerability.

== Examples
       *vulnscout ci* _"severity=high"_
              This example will cause the command to fail (exit code *2*)
              if any vulnerability with a severity level of "high" is
              found.

== Global syntax and language definition
       The full language definition can be found in
       `src/controllers/conditions_parser.py`. The following keywords
       are recognized:

       * `true`, `false`
       * `and`, `or`, `not`
       * `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
       * `0`, `5`, `2.3`, `-1`, `.42`, `25%` are recognized as numbers.
       * `(` ... `)` are used to group expressions.

       Any condition is always expressed as `<left token> <operator>
       <right token>`. For example: `cvss >= 5 or ignored == true`.

       *Note:* `true` alone is not a valid expression, but `true ==
       true` is.

== Tokens list
       In addition to the language definition above, the following
       tokens can be used in your conditions. They are defined in
       `src/bin/merger_ci.py`:

       * *id*
              The CVE ID of the vulnerability.

       * *cvss*
              A number representing the maximal CVSS score of the
              vulnerability. Generally between 0 and 10, but not
              guaranteed.

       * *cvss_min*
              A number representing the minimal CVSS score of the
              vulnerability. Generally between 0 and 10, but not
              guaranteed.

       * *epss*
              A number representing the EPSS score of the vulnerability.
              Ranges between 0 and 1.

       * *effort*
              A number representing the "most likely" estimation of time
              needed to fix the vulnerability. Expressed in seconds.

       * *effort_min*
              A number representing the "optimistic" estimation of time
              needed to fix the vulnerability. Expressed in seconds.

       * *effort_max*
              A number representing the "pessimistic" estimation of time
              needed to fix the vulnerability. Expressed in seconds.

       * *fixed*
              A boolean representing if the vulnerability status is
              fixed or not.

       * *ignored*
              A boolean representing if the vulnerability status is
              ignored or not.

       * *affected*
              A boolean representing if the vulnerability status is
              affecting the project or not.

       * *pending*
              A boolean representing if the vulnerability status is
              pending or not.

       * *new*
              A boolean representing if the vulnerability is new or not.

       Any other token will be treated as a string. Strings are not
       quoted, can start with [a-zA-Z] or an underscore `_`, and can
       contain [a-zA-Z0-9_-:].

== Common examples and tips
       Fail if any vulnerability is critical:
              `cvss >= 9.0`

       Fail if any vulnerability is critical or has both high CVSS and
       EPSS scores:
              `cvss >= 9.0 or (cvss >= 7.0 and epss >= 50%)`

       Fail if any vulnerability was not reviewed by a human yet:
              `pending == true`

       Fail if there are important vulnerabilities not fixed or ignored:
              `cvss >= 7.0 and (not fixed == true and not ignored ==
              true)`

       Or more concisely:
              `cvss >= 7 and fixed == false and ignored == false`

       Fail if a vulnerability with affected status doesn't have an
       effort set already:
              `affected == true and effort == false`

       Fail if a high vulnerability is affecting the product and needs
       less than an hour to fix:
              `cvss >= 7.0 and affected == true and effort < 3600`

       Fail if Log4j is found:
              `id == CVE-2021-44228`
