# AI Assessments

VulnScout can accept **AI-written vulnerability assessments**. An AI agent
researches a CVE, decides on a VEX status, and submits the assessment to
VulnScout, where it is stored as **pending review**. A pending AI assessment is
never treated as official — it does **not** affect a vulnerability's status and
is **not** included in the exported VEX — until a human reviewer explicitly
**approves** it in the web interface.

This page describes how to set up and use that workflow.

---

## How it works

Three pieces work together:

- **VulnScout** — runs the API and web interface, stores assessments, and
  provides the review UI.
- **vulnscout-mcp** — an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
  (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes VulnScout's assessment and
  variant-context APIs as tools an AI agent can call.
- **cve-assessment skill** — an agent skill (shipped in this repository under
  `.github/skills/cve-assessment/`) that guides the agent through researching a
  CVE and submitting the result via the MCP tools.

```
CVE / GHSA id
    ↓
AI agent + cve-assessment skill
    ↓  (calls MCP tools)
vulnscout-mcp  ──HTTP──▶  VulnScout API
    ↓
Pending AI assessment (origin = "ai")
    ↓
Human review in the web UI  ──▶  Approve (becomes official) / Reject (deleted)
```

Only one pending AI assessment is allowed per vulnerability **and** variant.

---

## Prerequisites

- A running VulnScout instance, reachable over HTTP (see
  [Getting Started](getting-started.md)). By default the API is served at
  `http://localhost:7275`.
- Python 3.9+ on the host that runs the MCP server.
- A clone of the `vulnscout-mcp` repository.
- An MCP-capable agent client — either the **GitHub Copilot CLI** or
  **VS Code** with the GitHub Copilot extension.

---

## Step 1 — Configure the vulnscout-mcp server

`vulnscout-mcp` speaks MCP over stdio and is launched as a subprocess by the
agent client — there is no port or daemon to manage yourself. Its
`run_server.py` launcher is self-bootstrapping: on first run it creates a local
`venv/`, installs its dependencies, and then starts the server. You only need to
clone the repository and point a client at the script.

The server reads a single environment variable:

| Environment variable | Default                 | Description                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:7275` | Base URL of the VulnScout API server |

### GitHub Copilot CLI

Add the server from the terminal:

```bash
copilot mcp add vulnscout \
  --env VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7275 \
  -- python3 /path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py
```

Or run `/mcp add` in interactive mode and fill in the form (**Type:** STDIO,
**Command:** `python3 /path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py`,
**Environment Variables:** `{"VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL":"http://localhost:7275"}`).

Equivalently, edit `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` directly:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vulnscout": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:7275"
      },
      "tools": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot extension)

Add a server entry to your workspace `.vscode/mcp.json` (or run
**MCP: Add Server** from the Command Palette and choose **Workspace** or
**Global**):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "vulnscout": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/vulnscout-mcp/run_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:7275"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP tools

Once configured, the agent can call these tools (prefixed with `vulnscout-`):

| Tool                       | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `write_assessment`         | Create a VEX assessment for a CVE on one or more packages   |
| `update_ai_assessment`     | Revise an existing pending AI assessment instead of duplicating it |
| `get_assessment`           | Retrieve a single VEX assessment by ID                      |
| `list_assessments_by_vuln` | List all VEX assessments recorded for a CVE                 |
| `has_ai_assessment`        | Check whether a pending AI assessment already exists        |
| `find_project_id` / `find_variant_id` | Resolve a project / variant by name             |
| `get_merged_context`       | Fetch the merged project + variant context for an assessment |
| `get_variant_context` / `update_variant_context` | Read / update variant context     |

## Step 2 — Use the cve-assessment skill

The `cve-assessment` skill lives in this repository at
`.github/skills/cve-assessment/`. An MCP-capable agent that has access to this
repository will discover the skill automatically and invoke it when you ask it
to assess a CVE.

Invoke it by describing the CVE and (optionally) the project context, for
example:

```
Assess CVE-2024-XXXXX for project "my-product", variant "production".
```

The skill resolves platform context using three tiers:

1. **MCP fetch** — if you provide a `project_name` (and optional
   `variant_name`, defaulting to `"default"`), the skill fetches the variant
   context from VulnScout via the MCP tools. The resolved `variant_id` is
   required to submit the assessment.
2. **Inline context** — if you describe the platform (package manager, build
   system, deployment environment) directly in the prompt, the skill uses that.
3. **Default fallback** — otherwise it proceeds with generic default
   objectives and no extra context.

The skill then researches the vulnerability, evaluates it against the project's
security objectives, assigns a status, and submits it via
`vulnscout-write_assessment` as a pending AI assessment.

```{note}
The skill's **security objectives profiles** and **report templates** are
customizable. See `.github/skills/cve-assessment/objectives/README.md` and the
`.github/skills/cve-assessment/report-templates/` directory for details.
```

## Step 3 — Review AI assessments in the web interface

Pending AI assessments must be reviewed by a human before they become official.

1. Open the assessed vulnerability in the VulnScout web interface.
2. A pending AI assessment appears in a highlighted panel **above** the normal
   assessment timeline, labelled **"AI-generated · Pending review"**. It shows
   the same details as a normal assessment (status, justification, impact
   statement, notes, packages, and variant).
3. Use the panel's action buttons:
   - **Approve** — promotes the assessment to an official (`custom`)
     assessment. It now affects the vulnerability's status and is included in
     the OpenVEX export.
   - **Reject** — deletes the pending AI assessment.

Until it is approved, a pending AI assessment has no effect on the
vulnerability's status, on scan history/diffs, or on any exported VEX.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **The agent cannot reach VulnScout** — verify that VulnScout is running and
  that `VULNSCOUT_BASE_URL` in the MCP configuration points to the correct API
  URL (default `http://localhost:7275`).
- **Submission is blocked with a missing `variant_id`** — the skill needs a
  `variant_id` to submit. Provide a `project_name`/`variant_name` (so it can be
  resolved via MCP) or a `variant_id` UUID directly in the prompt.
- **409 Conflict on submission** — a pending AI assessment already exists for
  that vulnerability and variant. Approve or reject the existing one first, or
  let the skill revise it via `vulnscout-update_ai_assessment`.
