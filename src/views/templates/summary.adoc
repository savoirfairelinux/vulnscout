== Most critical vulnerabilities

The following list use EPSS ranking to outline the vulnerabilities which are most used. The EPSS ranking is a metric that takes into account the number of known exploits, the ease of exploitation, the impact of the vulnerability, and the availability of a fix.

{% for vuln in vulnerabilities | as_list | status_active | sort_by_epss | epss_score(5) | limit(15) %}

**{{loop.index}}. {{ vuln.id }} ({{ vuln.severity.severity | capitalize }}) - EPSS: {{ "%.2f" | format(vuln.epss.score | float * 100) }} %**
